# The public surface of this repository, for a consumer who uses flakes.

# `default.nix` is how it builds. This file names what is public and calls it
# with a package set built from the flake's own nixpkgs, so a consumer who
# writes an input for this repository gets a curated set of outputs rather
# than nothing.
#
# One input, because there is one dependency.
