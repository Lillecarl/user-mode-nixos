# Where every dependency of this repository lives.
#
# nixidae is the umbrella that holds it, and the umbrella owns every source.
# Inside the umbrella that is the checkout two directories up. Outside it,
# the umbrella is fetched, and this working copy is put in place of the copy
# that came down with it. Either way the answer is the same one, so a build
# here and a build from the umbrella agree.
#
# A plain tarball is enough. The umbrella records every revision in
# nix/sources.lock, a file in its own tree, and the working copies beside it
# are ignored rather than committed, so a fetch that brings down none of them
# still resolves all of them.
#
# `..` from a store path leaves the store root, and Nix refuses that rather
# than answering false: "'nix' is too short to be a valid store path". So ask
# only when this checkout is not itself in the store.
#
# `flake.nix` is a second door for a consumer who uses flakes, and it hands
# `default.nix` its own nixpkgs rather than coming through here.  Everything
# else -- CI, a developer, the umbrella -- takes this one.

  # Where this checkout sits. Inside the umbrella, whether that umbrella is a

  # evaluate that at all: "'nix' is too short to be a valid store path".
  # `builtins.tryEval` does not catch it -- measured, not assumed -- so the
  # question has to be avoided rather than caught.
  #
  # A bare store path is exactly `/nix/store/` plus one component. Anything
  # deeper has a directory between this checkout and the store root, which is
  # precisely the case where the umbrella is the thing in the store and this
  # checkout is inside it.

  # Being in the store does not mean the umbrella is absent. An earlier
  # version tested "not in the store", which is only ever true in a working

  # took the fetch below instead of the umbrella it shipped inside.

  # variable a second time.
  #
  # `github:` here is unlocked -- no revision, no narHash -- so Nix asks
  # api.github.com for the head of the default branch on every evaluation
  # that `tarball-ttl` does not answer from cache. That is one call per job
  # before any source is resolved at all. Anonymous api.github.com allows 60
  # an hour per IP and GitHub's runners share a NAT pool.
  #
  # The git reference resolves the same head over the git protocol, which
  # that limit does not count.
